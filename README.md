# Flix Factory

## Description
The app is a TV show blogging platform. The use is very similar to a social media platform based on the ability to post and start a thread. A user has the ability to access blogs based on what network the show belongs to. There is also a feature where you can post a blog of your own, given that you have an account and are logged in. Flix Factory is a full stack website incorporating HTML/CSS, Javascript, Nodejs, Express, MySQL, Bootstrap, API.

## Installation
1. NPM i, axios, express
2. MySQL
3. BCrypt


## Usage
We created a Movie/TV blog board. Our users will be able to view and post about their favorite TV series. Users will have the option of viewing a feed of blogs without the chance to post, or create an account and be able to contribute to the blog board. Our app will target people who are currently watching a series or simply looking for opinions on a series they are interested in watching. Hopefully, they will join together and watch/blog/comment synchronously during new episodes or if they schedule their own watch parties.
